    "[Title] is a website dedicated towards mental health in DNHS and focuses on improving studentâ€™s mental wellbeing. With the increases in stress throughout high school, as students end up taking higher coursework and end up in loads of extracurriculars-- not to mention any personal and familial issues, many students find it hard to deal with the burden it can have on one's physical and mental health. This was the inspiration towards our website, as we hoped to create a website that is able to help aid any struggling students and let them know that they are not alone."
