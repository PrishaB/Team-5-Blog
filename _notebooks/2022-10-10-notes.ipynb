These criteria are that it can't have any extends, implements, annotations, and so that way it can be run just by itself. You can turn a Pojo into an entity with the \\@Entity annotation and then you must add an \\@Id annotation as every entity needs a unique identifier and so primary key values"

    "A Java Bean is also a pojo but it is a bit more strict. For example it has a bit more criteria and standards. These standards are that the properties must be private, there must be public gets and sets, and it must implement serializable which means that it can be written to things like databases and files. Additionally, it must have a no args constructor which will be given by default by java if you do not create one yourself. A no args constructor is just a constructor without a parameter"

Maven will download this automatically as the Bill of materials- the combination of jars that work well based on what versions you want. Maven is essentially the program for dependency management. "

    "Java will allow access to a TomCat server by default which would allow you to run your application on localhost in a closed loop. It will work as a webserver that will take in http requests on the port specified. Once you run your application, you need to find a way to control what code to run to any http requests. This is what a controller does. A controller uses Spring mvc to make a restAPI to do this (basically it will convert this list to json). The annotation to declare that this is a controller is \\@Controller and the annotation to state what url you are mapping to would be for example \\@GetMapping(\"/birds\"). The default for this would be a GET request so if you would like to use for example a POST request, you would need to mention it. Such as in your \\@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST, value =\"/      \"). It will map to this method when you gain this value request."
