<h1>Get active</h1>
<p> Virtually any form of physical activity can act as a stress reliever. 
    Even if you're not an athlete or you're out of shape, exercise can still be a good stress reliever.
    Physical activity can pump up your feel-good endorphins and other natural neural chemicals that enhance your sense of well-being. 
    Exercise can also refocus your mind on your body's movements, which can improve your mood and help the day's irritations fade away. </p>


<h1>Eat a healthy diet</h2>
<p> Eating a healthy diet is an important part of taking care of yourself. Aim to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, and whole grains.</p>

<h1>Laugh more</h1>
<p>A good sense of humor can't cure all ailments, but it can help you feel better, even if you have to force a fake laugh through your grumpiness. 
When you laugh, it not only lightens your mental load but also causes positive physical changes in your body. Laughter fires up and then cools down your stress response. So read some jokes, tell some jokes, watch a comedy or hang out with your funny friends. 
Or give laughter yoga a try.</p>


<h1>Get enough sleep</h1>
<p> Stress can cause you to have trouble falling asleep. 
    When you have too much to do — and too much to think about — your sleep can suffer. 
    But sleep is the time when your brain and body recharge.
    And the quality and amount of sleep you get can affect your mood, energy level, concentration and overall functioning. 
    If you have sleep troubles, make sure that you have a quiet, relaxing bedtime routine, listen to soothing music, put clocks away, and stick to a consistent schedule.</p>


<h1>Connect with others</h1>
<p>When you're stressed and irritable, your instinct may be to isolate yourself. Instead, reach out to family and friends and make social connections.
Social contact is a good stress reliever because it can offer distraction, provide support and help you tolerate life's up and downs. 
Got more time? Consider volunteering for a charitable group and help yourself while helping others.</p>
