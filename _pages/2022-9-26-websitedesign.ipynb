    "Health.ly is a website dedicated towards mental health in DNHS and focuses on improving studentâ€™s mental wellbeing. With the increases in stress throughout high school, as students end up taking higher coursework and end up in loads of extracurriculars-- not to mention any personal and familial issues, many students find it hard to deal with the burden it can have on one's physical and mental health. This was the inspiration towards our website, as we hoped to create a website that is able to help aid any struggling students and let them know that they are not alone. "

One of the things we were thinking of implementing would be to add a more personal account so when you sign up you would be able to jot down any preferences you have and this can help you match up with other like-minded folks which would be a great way to help meet new people and make new friends."
