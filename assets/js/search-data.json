            "content": "Brief Review . Loops . Methods . 2018 FRQ #1 Overview . The prompt is essentially a simulation of a frog hopping. The frog can jump back and forth and it is considered a success if it makes it to the goal in the amount of jumps given. . 2018IntroFRQ . 2018 FRQ #1a . Part A: The purpose is to make it so that if we call the method FrogSimulation using FrogSimulation sim = new FrogSimulation(24,5);. The simulation would have a goal at a distance of 24 inches and a maximum amount of 5 jumps. If the frog makes it to or past the goal sim, simulate will return true and if it is negative or has just not made it to the goal but is not a negative value then it will return false. . public class FrogSimulation { private int goalDistance; private int maxHops; public FrogSimulation(int dist, int numHops){ goalDistance=dist; maxHops=numHops; } private int hopDistance(){} public boolean simulate(){} public double runSimulations(int num){} } . 2018 FRQ #1a Solution . First we define location to be at zero, our starting point. Then we use a for loop so that i will continue to increase until it reaches the max number of hops and so that for as long as this happens, the frog will hop (ie. location= location+hopDistance, which means that the distance the frog jumps will be added to location every time the frog jumps in order to have the final location of the frog). After the frog has finished jumping, we used an if loop so that if the frog is at or beyond the goal then it will be true and if it is at a negative value or behind the starting value then it will return false. If the frog has used up all its jumps but has not made it to the goal or at a negative value then it will return false regardless which is done by a return false outside of the for loop. . public boolean simulate(){ int location=0; for (int i=0; i&lt;numHops; i++){ location +=hopDistance(); if(dist&lt;=location){ return true; } else if (location&lt;0){ return false; } } return false; } . 2018 FRQ #1b . Part B: We can then use the values given by the method simulate in order to finish the simulation of the frog. Prompt B is asking for us to finish the simulation and declare whether or not the frog has won the game i.e. made it to the goal, which we can find using the boolean values given by simulate, and then find the proportion of wins overall after a certain number of runs. . 2018 FRQ #1b Solution . This is a method called runSimulations and basically if we call this method such as FrogSimulation run = new FrogSimulation(23); it should run the simulation 23 times and count the number of successes- which will eventually be changed into a decimal of successes/tries. We do this by setting the number of successes to zero to begin with and then we use a for loop, with basically the same idea as part a, so that the code will run for as many times as directed. Then inside of that for loop, we have an if loop so that for as long as simulate runs true then the success counter will increase and the proportion of successes/tries will be returned. . public double runSimulations(int num){ int success=o; for(int i=0; i&lt;num; i++ ){ if(simulate()){ success++ } return success/num } } . 2021 FRQ #1 Overview . The reader is given a class labeled WordMatch which stores a secret string and contains methods to compare other strings to the secret string. In order to fully complete this question, the reader will have to create two methods that fulfill the requirements listed in each part. . Part A: scoreGuess method → comes up with a score for each guess . | Part B: findBetterGuess method → choose best from 2 guesses . | . 2021 FRQ #1a . Compare guess to substring of secret | Uses of substring secret with correct length for comparison with guess | Loops through all necessary substrings of secret | Counts number of identified occurences of guess within secret | Calculate and returns correct final score (algorithm) | . public class WordMatch{ private String secret; public WordMatch(String word){} public int scoreGuess(String guess){ int result = 0; for (int i = 0; a &lt; secret.length(); i++){ if(secret.substring(i).indexOf(guess) == 0){ result++; } } return result + guess.length() + guess.length(); } } . 2021 FRQ #1b . Calls scoreGuess to get scores for guess1 and guess2 | Compares the scores | Determines which guess1 and guess2 is alphabetically greater | Returns the identified guess1 or guess2 (algorithm) | . public String findBetterGuess(String guess1, String guess2){ if(scoreGuess(guess1) &gt; scoreGuess(guess2)){ return guess1; } if(scoreGuess(guess2) &gt; scoreGuess(guess1)){ return guess2; } if(guess1.compareTo(guess2) &gt; 0){ return guess1; } return guess2; } .

Second attempt is a soccer array . //Monkey thing but with dogs cuz we love dogs class DogLoop { //The area between class definition and the 1st method is where we keep data for object in Java String [][] dogs; //2D Array: AP CSA Unit 8: 2D array of strings //2D array is like a grid [x][y] // or like a spreadsheet [row][column] /** * Constructor initializes a 2D array of Dogs */ public DogLoop() { //Storing Data in 2D arrays dogs = new String[][]{ //2D array above is just a name, &quot;new&quot; makes a container (&quot;object&quot;) //Dog 1 { &quot; Sunny &quot;, &quot; __ &quot;, //[0][0] eyes &quot; (___()&#39;`;&quot;, //[0][1] chin &quot; /, /` &quot;, //[0][2] body &quot; &#39;- &quot; //[0][3] legs }, //Dog 2 { &quot; Aubrey &quot;, &quot; __ &quot;, //[1][0] &quot; | ______/ V`-,&quot;, &quot; } /~~ &quot;, &quot;/_)^ --,(_| &quot; }, //Dog 3 { &quot; Mari &quot;, &quot; __ _ &quot;, //[2][0] &quot;o&#39;&#39;)}____//&quot;, &quot; `_/ )&quot;, &quot;(_(_/-(_/ &quot; }, //Dog 4 { &quot; Kel &quot;, &quot;^..^ /&quot;, //[3][0] &quot;/_/|_____/ &quot;, &quot; /| /| &quot;, &quot; / | / | &quot; }, //Dog 5 { &quot; Basil &quot;, &quot; &quot;, //[4][0] &quot; ..^____/&quot;, //[4][1] &quot;`-. ___ )&quot;, //[4][2] &quot; || || &quot; //[4][3] }, //Dog 6 { &quot; Hero &quot;, &quot; __&quot;, //[4][0] &quot;(|,--&#39;()&#39;--o&quot;, //[4][1] &quot; (_ ___ /~&#39;&#39;&quot;, //[4][2] &quot; (_)_) (_)_)&quot; //[4][3] }, }; } /** * Loop and print dogs in array * ... repeat until you reach zero ... */ public void printPoem() { //begin the poem System.out.println(); System.out.println(&quot;Dogs in Kennel Poem in Java Loopy&quot;); // dogs (non-primitive) defined in constructor knows its length int dogCount = dogs.length; int rowCount = 0; for (int i = dogCount; i &gt;= 1; i--) //loops through 2D array length backwards { //this print statement shows current count of dogs // concatenation (+) of the loop variable and string to form a countdown message System.out.println(i + &quot; little dogs in the kennel, waiting to find a forever home...&quot;); for (int col = 0; col &lt; dogs[rowCount].length; col++) { for (int row = 0; row &lt; dogCount; row++) { //cycles through &quot;cells&quot; of 2d array // prints specific part of the dog from the column System.out.print(dogs[row][col] + &quot; &quot;); } //this new line gives separation between stanza of poem System.out.println(); } rowCount += 1; //countdown for poem, decrementing dogCount variable by 1 dogCount -= 1; } //out of all the loops, prints finishing messages System.out.println(&quot;Yay!

Part A . The distance away from the goal is defined as dist while the number of jumps given is defined as numHops so if we call the method FrogSimulation using FrogSimulation sim= new FrogSimulation(24,5);. The simulation would have a goal at a distance of 24 inches and a maximum amount of 5 jumps.

Then inside of that for loop, we have an if loop so that for as long as simulate runs true then the success counter will increase and the proportion of successes/tries will be returned . public double runSimulations(int num){ int success=0; for(int i=0; i&lt;num; i++ ){ if(simulate()){ success++ } return success/num; } } .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
